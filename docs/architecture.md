# Architecture

## Overview

Thong Biltong is a static brochure site with a small serverless backend for
handling order submissions and a headless CMS for managing shop content. It is a
pnpm workspace with three packages, plus a Terraform module for infrastructure
and GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD:

- `frontend/` — SvelteKit (Svelte 5), built with `@sveltejs/adapter-static`. Ships as
  pre-rendered HTML + assets. The shop prerenders as a static shell with
  skeleton loading states, then fetches product data from the backend at
  runtime via client-side `onMount`.
- `backend/` — Hono app, written once and deployed two ways: as a local Node HTTP
  server for development and as an AWS Lambda handler for production. Bundled
  with esbuild.
- `studio/` — Sanity Studio v5, a dashboard where the shop owner manages products
  (name, price, photos, availability). Runs locally or as a free hosted app at
  `*.sanity.studio`.
- `infra/` — Terraform module that provisions all AWS resources (S3, CloudFront,
  Lambda, API Gateway HTTP API, IAM, Route 53, ACM, GitHub OIDC). Not a workspace package.
- `.github/workflows/` — three deploy workflows (frontend, backend, studio)
  that authenticate to AWS via OIDC and run when a GitHub release is published
  (release-gated, with skip-if-unchanged checks per workspace).

The three app packages are decoupled. The frontend knows the backend only by its
URL (`PUBLIC_API_URL`), and knows Sanity only by a project ID
(`PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`). The backend has no knowledge of Sanity or the
frontend — it just receives order submissions and sends emails.

## Frontend

SvelteKit with `adapter-static`. Most routes have `prerender = true` (set in
`+layout.ts`), so the build emits one real `.html` file per route:

```
build/
├── _app/           JS chunks, CSS, fonts
├── index.html
├── shop.html
├── contact.html
├── privacy.html
└── 404.html        SPA fallback — see below
```

This is the directory that uploads to S3. CloudFront sits in front for caching and
TLS termination. No server-side rendering, no runtime, no Node process.

**SPA fallback for dynamic routes.** The product detail route `/shop/[slug]`
can't be enumerated at build time (slugs come from Sanity), so its
`+page.ts` sets `prerender = false; ssr = false;` and the static adapter
is configured with `fallback: '404.html'`. The emitted `404.html` is an
SPA shell that boots, reads the URL, and renders the matching product
page. CloudFront's `custom_error_response` in `infra/s3_cloudfront.tf`
rewrites 404 and 403 responses to `/404.html` with HTTP 200, so direct
visits to dynamic routes resolve correctly without leaking a 4xx status.

The shop page includes client-side JavaScript that submits the order form to the
backend via `fetch`. The backend URL is baked into the bundle at build time from
`PUBLIC_API_URL` via `$env/static/public`. There is no runtime environment resolution
on the frontend — rebuilding is required to change the backend URL.

Product data is fetched at **runtime** by the browser, not at
build time. The shop route prerenders a static HTML shell containing the
layout chrome, heading, lede, and a skeleton loading state. On hydration,
the component's `onMount` fires and makes a client-side `fetch` to
`${PUBLIC_API_URL}/products`. The backend reads from Sanity using its API
token and returns the data as JSON. The skeleton swaps for real content,
then `loading="lazy"` images download progressively as the user scrolls.

This pattern has three deliberate properties:

1. **First paint is instant** — the shell comes from CloudFront/S3 in
   ~100 ms globally; visitors see layout, heading, and skeletons before
   any data or images are requested
2. **Content is live** — because the fetch runs on every visit, a product
   edit in Sanity Studio is visible within seconds without a frontend
   rebuild (the "rebuild on publish" webhook still exists but is only
   strictly needed for content that's baked at build time, which for now
   is nothing)
3. **The site stays fully static** — no server, no SSR at runtime, no
   Node process on the hot path. S3 + CloudFront serves everything; the
   Lambda is only invoked when a browser hits `/orders`, `/products`,
   `/products/:slug`, or `/testimonials`, or when Sanity or Stripe posts
   to a `/webhooks/*` endpoint

If the backend is unreachable when the client tries to fetch, the component
shows an error state and the skeleton clears. Empty responses (no products
yet) show a friendly "no products listed yet" empty state instead.

## Backend

Hono, a small TypeScript HTTP framework that runs anywhere `fetch` exists: Node,
Workers, Lambda, Bun, Deno. One app definition (`src/app.ts`) is shared by two
entry points:

- `src/server.ts` uses `@hono/node-server` to run it as a real HTTP server on port
  3001 for local development. `tsx watch` reloads on change.
- `src/lambda.ts` wraps the same app with `hono/aws-lambda` and exports a
  `handler` function that AWS Lambda invokes for each request.

Handler code, routing, and middleware are identical across both — the only
difference is how requests reach the app.

### Routes

- `GET /health` — liveness check, returns `{ ok: true }`
- `GET /products` — returns the list of published + available products from
  Sanity. Called by the frontend's shop page at runtime (client-side `fetch`
  in `onMount`). This endpoint exists so the Sanity dataset can stay private
  while the product catalogue is still visible on the public site.
- `GET /products/:slug` — returns a single published, available product by
  slug. Called by the frontend's `/shop/[slug]` detail page at runtime.
  Returns 404 when no matching product exists, which the page renders as
  a "product not found" state.
- `GET /testimonials` — returns the list of visible testimonials from
  Sanity, ordered by the `order` field. Called by the home page at
  runtime; the testimonials section silently no-ops if the response is
  empty or the fetch fails.
- `POST /orders` — accepts an order JSON body with a `cart` array, validates
  it, looks up product prices in Sanity, generates a reference `TB-YYMMDD-XXXXXX`,
  **creates a Sanity `order` document**, sends the owner notification email,
  creates a Stripe Checkout session, and returns the hosted session URL:
  `{ success, ref, stripe: { sessionId, url } }`
- `GET /orders/:ref?email=…` — customer-facing order lookup. Queries Sanity
  by `orderRef`, verifies the provided email matches the stored email, and
  returns a sanitised subset (no internal notes, no phone, no shipping
  address). 404 on both missing ref and email mismatch to prevent
  enumeration.
- `POST /enquiries` — commission enquiry form on `/contact`. Validates
  the body (required name/email/message + length limits, honeypot, valid
  email regex), then sends a single notification email to `OWNER_EMAIL`
  via Resend with `replyTo` set to the visitor's claimed email and a
  prominent unverified-sender warning rendered in the email body. No
  Sanity document is created — at the current scale, treating enquiries
  as a transient email is simpler than another data store.
- `POST /webhooks/sanity-order` — receives webhook POSTs from Sanity when an
  order's `status` field changes. Verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature on the
  **raw** request body (before JSON parsing) against
  `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, then dispatches the appropriate status-change
  email to the customer via Resend.
- `POST /webhooks/stripe` — receives Stripe webhook events after a
  customer completes checkout. The handler reads the raw body and the
  `stripe-signature` header, verifies the HMAC-SHA256 signature over
  `timestamp + '.' + rawBody` using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and on a
  valid `checkout.session.completed` event whose amount matches the
  stored order, updates the Sanity order status to `payment_received`
  — which triggers the Sanity webhook above and sends the customer
  their confirmation email.

### CORS

`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` is a comma-separated env var checked by `hono/cors` middleware.
The browser is only permitted to call the backend from origins in that list. In
local development it is `http://localhost:7777`; in production it is the
CloudFront domain.

### Email

Resend is called directly via `fetch` — no SDK dependency. The wrapper lives
in `src/email.ts`. Templates are extracted into `src/email-templates.ts`,
keyed by order status:

- `ownerNotification()` — sent to the owner on every new order
- `pending_payment` — fallback "we've received your order, awaiting payment"
  (the normal Stripe flow redirects straight to checkout, so this template
  only fires if the team manually resets an order's status)
- `payment_received` — "we got your payment, shipping soon"
- `shipped` — "on the way", including tracking info if present
- `delivered` — optional "hope you love it"
- `cancelled` — "your order was cancelled"

Each customer email includes a tracking link deep-linked with the customer's
ref and email (`/track?ref=…&email=…`) so they can bookmark or revisit at any
time.

### Sanity client

`src/sanity.ts` wraps `@sanity/client` and exposes `createOrder()`,
`updateOrderPayment()`, `getOrderByRef()`, `getProducts()`,
`getProductBySlug()`, `getProductsByIds()`, and `getTestimonials()`.
Uses `SANITY_API_TOKEN` for authentication — writes and reads both
require the token, because the dataset is configured as private in the
Sanity dashboard.
The frontend never talks to Sanity's query API directly; it only builds
image URLs from the public asset CDN using the project ID baked into its
bundle.

## Studio

Sanity Studio v5, configured in `studio/sanity.config.ts`. It is a standalone React
application, not part of the SvelteKit app. It runs in one of three places:

- **Locally** via `pnpm studio dev` on `http://localhost:3333`. Used during
  schema development and content authoring before the studio is published.
- **Hosted by Sanity** via `pnpm studio deploy`. Produces a free
  `https://<name>.sanity.studio` URL that the shop owner logs into from anywhere.
- **Self-hosted** (optional) by bundling with `pnpm studio build` and uploading
  `studio/dist` to any static host. Not the recommended path — the hosted studio
  is free and requires no ops.

Schemas are defined in `studio/schemas/`. Adding a new schema means creating a
file, registering it in `schemas/index.ts`, and (usually) adding a backend
route that fetches it via the authenticated Sanity client. Three schemas
currently exist: `product`, `testimonial`, and `order`.

The studio reads `SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID` and `SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET` from its
own `.env`. The frontend reads the *same* project via `PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
and `PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` in its `.env`. Both sides must point to the same
project for content to flow through.

## Content flow (products)

Products are fetched at **runtime** by the visitor's browser, not baked
into the static build. Edits appear on the live site within seconds — no
rebuild, no webhook, no CI round-trip.

The `deploy-frontend.yml` workflow also accepts `repository_dispatch` events
from a content-rebuild webhook, which is useful for content baked at build
time. With products fetched at runtime, this webhook isn't strictly
required today, but it's ready to wire up if home page copy ever moves
into Sanity (it's currently hardcoded). Setup instructions are in
[`deployment.md`](./deployment.md) section 9.

## Order creation flow

### Stripe Checkout payment flow

```
Browser (shop.html + JS)
    │
    │ POST /orders  { paymentMethod: 'stripe', cart: [...], ... }
    ▼
Backend Hono app
    │
    │ validate → look up product prices in Sanity → compute total
    │ generate ref → create Sanity order (pending_payment, paymentMethod: stripe)
    │ send owner notification email
    │ create Stripe Checkout session with the computed line items
    ▼
Returns { success, ref, stripe: { sessionId, url } }
    │
    ▼
Browser redirects to stripe.url → customer lands on Stripe Checkout
    │
    ▼
Customer pays on Stripe's hosted page
    │
    ├──▶ Redirect → /payment/complete?ref=…
    │
    └──▶ Webhook (server-to-server POST) → /webhooks/stripe
              │
              │ verify stripe-signature (HMAC-SHA256 timestamp.body)
              │ match event amount to stored order
              ▼
         Update Sanity order: status → payment_received
              │
              ▼
         Existing Sanity webhook fires → "payment received" email
```

## Order status-update flow

```
Owner in Sanity Studio
    │ changes status field, clicks Publish
    ▼
Sanity (filter: _type == "order" && delta::changedAny(status))
    │ fires webhook → POST /webhooks/sanity-order
    ▼
Backend Hono app
    │ verify HMAC-SHA256 over raw body
    │ look up email template for new status
    ▼
Resend API
    │
    └──▶ customer              (payment received / shipped / delivered / cancelled)
```

## Order tracking flow

```
Customer clicks tracking link in email (or visits /track directly)
    │
    ▼
/track page hydrates (prerendered shell + client-only component)
    │ GET /orders/:ref?email=…
    ▼
Backend
    │ query Sanity by orderRef, verify email matches, sanitise fields
    ▼
Customer sees status, progress indicator, tracking info (if shipped)
```

Orders live as structured documents in Sanity. The team manages their
lifecycle in Studio; the backend creates documents, reads documents for
lookups, and receives status-change webhooks. Customer PII is stored on
the order document and must not live on a public Sanity dataset in
production — see `orders-and-tracking.md` for the fix before launch.
Payment is via Stripe Checkout (Card, Apple Pay, Google Pay) with
automatic confirmation via the Stripe webhook.

## Deployment targets

- **Frontend**: S3 bucket (private, blocked public access) + CloudFront
  distribution with Origin Access Control. ACM certificate in `us-east-1`
  (CloudFront requirement). Route 53 A-alias records for apex and `www`.
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda fronted by API Gateway v2 (HTTP API), with
  CloudFront routing `/api/*` to API Gateway via a second origin. A
  CloudFront Function strips the `/api` prefix before forwarding, so Hono
  routes stay at `/orders`, `/products`, etc. The Lambda code is bundled to
  a single `dist/lambda.mjs` via esbuild, zipped, uploaded by CI. IAM
  execution role with CloudWatch Logs permission. 30-day log retention.
  Historical note: the backend originally used a Lambda Function URL, but
  that feature hit an undiagnosable AWS-side 403 in this account + region
  for every invocation (public or IAM-signed via CloudFront OAC). API
  Gateway uses a different gateway pipeline and works correctly.
- **Studio**: hosted by Sanity at `https://<name>.sanity.studio` via
  `pnpm studio deploy`. No AWS resources involved.

Infrastructure is defined in Terraform at `infra/`. One apply creates all AWS
resources above plus the GitHub OIDC provider and CI role. State is stored in
an S3 bucket with a DynamoDB lock table (created manually once; see
`infra/README.md` for the bootstrap commands). The primary region is
`af-south-1` (Cape Town); the ACM cert provider alias targets `us-east-1`.

CI/CD lives in `.github/workflows/`:
- `ci.yml` — typecheck + vitest on every PR and push. Never deploys.
- `deploy-frontend.yml` — runs on `release: published`. Check job diffs the
  release tag against the previous release, scoped to `frontend/**` + shared
  files; deploys only if anything relevant changed. Also responds to
  `repository_dispatch: sanity-publish` events from the Sanity content-rebuild
  webhook (always deploys in that case).
- `deploy-backend.yml` — runs on `release: published`, same skip-if-unchanged
  logic scoped to `backend/**`. Typechecks, bundles with esbuild, zips,
  updates the Lambda via `aws lambda update-function-code`.
- `deploy-studio.yml` — runs on `release: published`, same skip-if-unchanged
  logic scoped to `studio/**`. Runs `sanity deploy`.
- `dependabot-lockfile.yml` — runs on Dependabot PRs that touch any
  `package.json`. Regenerates the root `pnpm-lock.yaml` with
  `pnpm install --lockfile-only` and commits it back, because Dependabot
  itself only rewrites per-workspace `package.json` and leaves the shared
  root lockfile stale (which otherwise breaks `ci.yml`'s `--frozen-lockfile`).
  Requires a `DEPENDABOT_LOCKFILE_PAT` repo secret — see the workflow file.

All three deploy workflows authenticate to AWS via **GitHub OIDC federation** — no
long-lived access keys are stored in the repo. The IAM role's trust policy
is scoped to the `production` GitHub Actions environment of the repo (not
the `main` branch, because release-triggered workflows run with
`github.ref = refs/tags/<tag>`, which a branch-scoped trust policy would
reject).

Full walkthrough of first-time deployment: see
[`deployment.md`](./deployment.md).
