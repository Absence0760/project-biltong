# Thong Biltong

Website for Thong Biltong — a South African biltong brand with a cheeky
cartoon mascot (a bull in a thong). A static brochure site with an online
shop, checkout via Stripe (cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay), and a content
management dashboard for the shop owner to manage products themselves.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (Svelte 5) built with `adapter-static`, hosted on S3
  + CloudFront
- **Backend**: Hono on AWS Lambda fronted by API Gateway (HTTP API), sends
  order emails via Resend
- **CMS**: Sanity Studio v3, hosted at `*.sanity.studio`
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform (`infra/`) — S3, CloudFront, Lambda, API
  Gateway, IAM, Route 53, ACM, GitHub OIDC
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`) deploying via OIDC
  federation (no long-lived AWS keys)

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install

# First-time only: provision a dedicated KMS key for this project's secrets
# and seed the SOPS-encrypted files from examples. Requires AWS CLI auth.
# See docs/deployment.md § Secrets management for the full workflow.
./bin/sops-init.sh

# Decrypt the backend secrets into a local .env for pnpm dev:
sops -d backend/.env.sops > backend/.env

# Frontend and studio have public, non-secret env vars — plain copy is fine:
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
cp studio/.env.example studio/.env

pnpm dev                    # frontend (:7777) + backend (:3001)
pnpm studio dev             # Sanity Studio (:3333) — run separately when needed
```

See [`docs/run-locally.md`](./docs/run-locally.md) for the full setup walkthrough
and [`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md) for the SOPS workflow.

## One-command production deploy

Once prerequisites are in place (AWS / GitHub / Sanity / Resend / Stripe
accounts, `af-south-1` enabled, `infra/terraform.tfvars` filled in), the
entire infrastructure setup is one command:

```bash
./bin/setup.sh
```

It creates the Terraform state backend, runs `terraform apply`, populates
GitHub Actions environment variables, and (with `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` set)
configures the Sanity webhook and dataset privacy. See
[`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md) for the complete walkthrough
and what still needs manual attention.
