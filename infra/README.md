# Infrastructure

Terraform configuration for the Thong Biltong AWS resources.

## What it creates

- **S3 bucket** hosting the prerendered SvelteKit site
- **CloudFront distribution** with Origin Access Control in front of the bucket
- **CloudFront response headers policy** applying HSTS (1y, includeSubDomains,
  preload), X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, and
  Referrer-Policy strict-origin-when-cross-origin to every response
- **ACM certificate** (in us-east-1, as CloudFront requires) with DNS validation
- **Route 53 records** for the apex domain, `www`, and cert validation
- **Lambda function** running the Hono backend as an ESM bundle
- **API Gateway v2 (HTTP API)** fronting the Lambda via an AWS_PROXY
  integration. CloudFront's `/api/*` behavior forwards to API Gateway, so
  the backend is reachable at `thongbiltong.co.za/api/*`. A CloudFront
  Function strips the `/api` prefix before forwarding, keeping Hono routes
  at their natural paths (`/orders`, `/products`, etc.).
- **Lambda execution IAM role** + CloudWatch log group (30-day retention)
- **GitHub OIDC provider** + IAM role for CI, trust-policied to the
  `production` GitHub Actions environment (environment-scoped rather than
  branch-scoped so release-triggered deploys on `refs/tags/*` work)
- **AWS Budget** with email alerts at 50% / 80% / 100% of a configurable
  monthly cap (default $30 — see `monthly_budget_usd` in `variables.tf`)
- **EventBridge schedule** that invokes the backend Lambda monthly (04:00
  UTC on the 1st) for the POPIA retention sweep — see `pii_cleanup.tf`

## Prerequisites

- Terraform `>= 1.6.0`
- AWS CLI v2 configured with credentials for a user that can create IAM, S3,
  CloudFront, Lambda, and Route 53 resources
- The apex domain's Route 53 hosted zone must already exist (Terraform will
  not create it, only add records to it)
- The `af-south-1` region must be **enabled** in your AWS account (Account
  → AWS Regions → enable Africa (Cape Town))

## Easiest path: use `bin/setup.sh`

The project ships with a one-command bootstrap script at
[`../bin/setup.sh`](../bin/setup.sh) that handles every step below
automatically (plus populates GitHub Actions env vars and Sanity webhooks).

```bash
./bin/setup.sh
```

If you'd rather run things by hand — or you want to understand what the
script does — read on.

## One-time bootstrap (before `terraform init`)

> The setup script does this for you. This section is the manual version.

Terraform stores its state in an S3 bucket with a DynamoDB lock table. You
must create these manually the first time, because Terraform can't create its
own state backend.

```bash
export AWS_REGION=af-south-1

aws s3api create-bucket \
  --bucket thong-biltong-tfstate \
  --region "$AWS_REGION" \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint="$AWS_REGION"

aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket thong-biltong-tfstate \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
  --bucket thong-biltong-tfstate \
  --server-side-encryption-configuration '{
    "Rules": [{"ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {"SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"}}]
  }'

aws s3api put-public-access-block \
  --bucket thong-biltong-tfstate \
  --public-access-block-configuration \
    BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true

aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name thong-biltong-tfstate-lock \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
  --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \
  --region "$AWS_REGION"
```

The `backend "s3"` block in `main.tf` is already configured with these
bucket/table names, so the next `terraform init` will pick them up.

## Configure

```bash
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
$EDITOR terraform.tfvars  # fill in real values
```

`terraform.tfvars` is gitignored.

### Required variables

Standard set: `domain_name`, `route53_zone_id`, `github_repo`,
`resend_api_key`, `from_email`, `owner_email`, `sanity_project_id`,
`sanity_api_token`, `sanity_webhook_secret`.

Stripe-specific:

- `stripe_secret_key` — `sk_test_…` or `sk_live_…`. Marked `sensitive = true`.
- `stripe_webhook_secret` — HMAC secret from the Stripe dashboard for the
  `/webhooks/stripe` endpoint. Marked `sensitive = true`.
- `stripe_currency` — ISO code, defaults to `zar`.

## Apply

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan            # review the changes
terraform apply
```

The first apply takes ~15 minutes (most of it waiting for CloudFront to
propagate). After it finishes, Terraform prints the outputs — copy
`github_actions_role_arn`, `api_url`, and `cloudfront_distribution_id`
into your GitHub Actions workflow secrets/variables (see `docs/deployment.md`).

## Rotating secrets

To rotate `resend_api_key` or any `stripe_*` secret, update the value in
`terraform.tfvars` and run `terraform apply`. This updates the Lambda's
environment variables in place. No code redeploy needed.

## Tearing down

```bash
terraform destroy
```

This removes everything Terraform created. It does **not** remove the state
bucket or DynamoDB lock table — those were created manually in the bootstrap
step and you must delete them by hand if you want a clean slate.

## Why not CDK?

The rest of the stack is TypeScript, so CDK would have been a natural fit.
Terraform was chosen because:

- It's declarative HCL, which is easier to read and review than generated
  CloudFormation
- State is explicit and portable — you can see exactly what Terraform thinks
  exists, and moving it between machines is a single `s3 cp` command
- The provider ecosystem covers Sanity, GitHub, and Cloudflare if the project
  ever needs them, without switching tools
