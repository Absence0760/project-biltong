# Security

Cross-cutting security risks and mitigations for Thong Biltong. This
doc is the single place to look for "is X safe?" and "what are we not
protecting against?". Pair it with `docs/orders-and-tracking.md`, which has
the detailed design of the order flow.

**Threat model in one sentence:** a small-volume e-commerce site with one
operator, Stripe Checkout as the payment processor (hosted session model,
no card data on our server), and no customer accounts. The worst
plausible outcomes are (1) fraudsters impersonating the business, (2) PII
leakage from order documents, and (3) automated spam of the order form or
webhook endpoints. We are **not** trying to defend against targeted
nation-state adversaries.

---

## Risk register

Each risk is rated **likelihood × impact** on a small-business scale:

- **Likelihood:** low / medium / high — how often this is realistically going
  to happen to a site at this scale.
- **Impact:** low / medium / high — how much damage a successful instance
  does.

### 1. Impersonation scams (banking details)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | medium |
| **Impact** | high |

**What could happen:** A fraudster harvests banking details (from an
invoice, from the site, from a leaked email) and sends fake "urgent overdue
invoice" messages to third parties impersonating Thong Biltong. The
victim pays the real account number, the team later gets complaints from
strangers who think they were scammed. Reputational damage far exceeds
the direct financial loss.

**Current mitigations:**
- Banking details are **not** on the shop page.
- Banking details are **not** in any automated email (neither owner
  notification nor customer confirmation).
- Banking details are **not** in `backend/.env.example`, `infra/variables.tf`,
  or anywhere else in git.
- Banking details are sent only as a **direct manual reply** from the
  team to the order-confirmation email thread, after reading the order.
- A regression test (`backend/src/__tests__/email.test.ts` → "never leaks
  banking details in the pending-payment email") fails if `account number`
  or `branch code` text appears in the automated customer email.
- The customer acknowledgement email sets expectations: it tells the
  customer to expect a personal reply with banking details, so a two-email
  sequence doesn't look like a scam to the customer either.

**Residual risk:**
- Once the reply has been sent, the details are in the customer's inbox
  and their mail provider's retention — out of our control.
- The sending email account is now the weakest link. If it's
  compromised, so is every banking reply. **Mitigation for later:** turn on
  2FA on the email account used to send replies (Gmail, Outlook, whatever).
  This is outside the repo.

**What would reduce residual risk further (not implemented):**
- Dedicated sender domain with strict DMARC/SPF/DKIM, so impersonation
  attempts from lookalike domains fail delivery.
- Watermarked PDF invoices with the order reference and amount, so victims
  of an impersonation scam can distinguish a real Thong Biltong invoice
  from a forged one.

### 2. Order-form abuse / automated order spam

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | high |
| **Impact** | low |

**What could happen:** Bots submit junk orders to the form. Each one creates
a Sanity document, triggers two Resend API calls, and clutters the team's
inbox.

**Current mitigations:**
- Honeypot field (`website`) in the order form. If filled, the backend
  silently returns `{ success: true, ref: 'SKIPPED' }` — no Sanity write, no
  email. Tests cover this (`orders.test.ts` → "treats a filled honeypot as
  a silent skip").
- Backend validation: required fields, valid email regex, length limits on
  every field. Tests cover every length limit.
- CORS restricts browser-origin submissions to the allowlisted domains.
  Server-to-server clients still reach it, but CORS cuts down on
  opportunistic browser-side exploitation.
- **Per-IP rate limiting** (`backend/src/rate-limit.ts`) on every
  state-changing endpoint, configured at the route level:

  | Route | Limit |
  |---|---|
  | `POST /orders` | 5 / 15 minutes per IP |
  | `POST /enquiries` | 5 / 15 minutes per IP |
  | `GET /orders/:ref` | 20 / minute per IP |
  | `POST /webhooks/sanity-order` | 60 / minute per IP |
  | `POST /webhooks/stripe` | 60 / minute per IP |

  Implementation is an in-memory fixed-window limiter keyed on the first
  IP in `x-forwarded-for` (populated by CloudFront / API Gateway as the
  request traverses the front-door stack).
  Over the limit returns `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After`
  header. Covered by `__tests__/rate-limit.test.ts` (12 tests including
  integration regression guards on `/orders` and `/orders/:ref`).

**Residual risk:**
- **In-memory limits are per-Lambda-instance.** A request that lands on a
  cold-started instance starts with a fresh bucket; under heavy
  concurrency, the effective global limit is `max × instances`. For
  single-IP flooding this is still meaningfully restrictive; for
  distributed-attacker mitigation (botnet), a shared store (DynamoDB,
  Redis) or AWS WAF in front of CloudFront / API Gateway would be needed. Out of
  scope at current volume.
- Bots that run a headless browser and don't fill the honeypot can still
  succeed up to the rate-limit cap. Sanity is the backstop — the team
  sees every order and can mark obvious junk as `cancelled`.

---

### 3. Order enumeration

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | low |
| **Impact** | medium |

**What could happen:** An attacker guesses order references (`TB-YYMMDD-XXXXXX`)
to look up strangers' orders on `/track`.

**Current mitigations:**
- `XXXXXX` is 6 random base-36 characters (~2.2 billion combinations per day).
- `GET /orders/:ref` requires an email parameter that must match the order's
  `customerEmail` (case-insensitive). Without the email, the endpoint
  returns 404.
- A **wrong email** returns 404 (not 403), so an attacker can't distinguish
  "real ref, wrong email" from "fake ref". Covered by tests.

**Residual risk:**
- The 20/min lookup rate limit caps brute-force attempts at ~28k/day per
  IP. With 6-char base-36 entropy (~2.2B refs per day) and required email
  verification, fully enumerating one day's refs from a single IP would
  take ~78,000 days; from 1,000 distributed IPs, ~78 days. Computationally
  infeasible at any realistic scale.

---

### 4. Sanity webhook forgery

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | low |
| **Impact** | medium |

**What could happen:** An attacker POSTs a forged webhook to
`/webhooks/sanity-order`, triggering unwanted "payment received" or
"shipped" emails to customers.

**Current mitigations:**
- Every webhook request is HMAC-SHA256 verified against
  `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` over the **raw request body** (before JSON
  parsing, so body-tampering doesn't slip past). Implemented with
  `timingSafeEqual`.
- Missing header, malformed header, wrong secret, and tampered-body cases
  are all tested (`sanity-webhook.test.ts` — 11 tests).
- A missing `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on the Lambda short-circuits to 500
  before any signature check, so a mis-configured prod can't become
  accidentally open.

**Residual risk:**
- If `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` leaks, so does the webhook. Rotate if the
  Lambda's env vars are ever suspected of exposure. Rotation is
  `terraform apply` + updating the secret in the Sanity dashboard.

---

### 5. PII in `/orders/:ref` responses

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | medium |
| **Impact** | medium |

**What could happen:** The tracking endpoint returns `customerPhone`,
`shippingAddress`, or `internalNotes` to anyone who knows the ref + email.
A customer forwarding their tracking link (innocently or not) could
inadvertently dox themselves.

**Current mitigations:**
- `backend/src/routes/order-lookup.ts` runs every Sanity order through a
  hand-written `sanitise()` function that **explicitly omits**
  `customerPhone`, `shippingAddress`, and `internalNotes`. The response
  shape is closed — not a passthrough.
- Tested: `orders.test.ts` → "returns a sanitised order when the email
  matches" asserts both that expected fields are present and that
  `customerPhone`/`shippingAddress` are `undefined`.

**Residual risk:**
- `customerName` and `items` are in the response. Both are required for the
  tracking UI to be useful, so this is accepted.

---

### 6. PII in tracking URLs

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | medium |
| **Impact** | low |

**What could happen:** Tracking links in emails are
`/track?ref=...&email=...`. The customer's email lands in browser history,
referrer headers, and any proxy logs along the path.

**Current mitigations:**
- The email parameter is only the customer's own email, not anyone else's.
- The worst case is "customer's own email in their own browser history" —
  not a disclosure to third parties.

**Residual risk:**
- If a customer shares a tracking URL publicly (e.g. in a support forum
  screenshot), their email is visible.
- External referrers: if the customer clicks an external link from the
  `/track` page, their email could leak via Referer header. Mitigated by
  SvelteKit's default `referrer` policy, which is `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  for modern browsers, so the query string is not forwarded cross-origin.

**What would reduce residual risk (not implemented):**
- Sign a short-lived token in the confirmation email instead of putting the
  email in the URL. Swap `?ref=…&email=…` for `?t=<jwt>`. Adds complexity
  and a key to manage. Not worth it at current scale.

---

### 7. Cross-origin access (CORS)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | low |
| **Impact** | medium |

**What could happen:** A malicious site tricks a logged-in user's browser
into submitting requests to the backend on their behalf.

**Current mitigations:**
- CORS is strictly origin-matched against `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (prod) or
  `http://localhost:7777` (local fallback). Non-listed origins get **no**
  `access-control-allow-origin` header, so browser fetches fail.
- CORS `allowMethods` is limited to `GET, POST, OPTIONS`. No `DELETE`, no
  `PUT`.
- Tested: `app.test.ts` covers both listed and unlisted origin cases, plus
  OPTIONS preflight.

**Residual risk:**
- There is no CSRF token on `POST /orders`, because there is no session /
  login — the form is available to anonymous users by design. CORS is the
  only gate. Acceptable for a public order form.

---

### 8. Secrets management

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | low |
| **Impact** | high |

**What could happen:** A secret (Resend API key, Sanity API token, webhook
secret) leaks via git history, CI logs, a compromised dev machine, or
ends up encrypted with the wrong key.

**Current mitigations:**
- **SOPS + AWS KMS encryption.** `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops` and
  `backend/.env.sops` are committed to the repo as encrypted blobs. The
  encryption root is a project-dedicated KMS key (`alias/thong-biltong-sops`
  in `af-south-1`) with `kms:Decrypt` gated by IAM. See
  `docs/deployment.md § Secrets management` for the full workflow and
  recovery procedures.
- **Access is IAM-bound, not file-bound.** There is no private key file on
  any laptop. Whoever has `kms:Decrypt` on the project's KMS key — via
  their IAM identity's policies — can decrypt. Revocation is an IAM
  change, takes effect immediately.
- **CloudTrail records every `kms:Decrypt` call** against the key. If a
  credential is suspected leaked, CloudTrail tells you when it was last
  used and from what source.
- **Automatic key-material rotation is enabled** on the KMS key. AWS
  rotates the underlying cryptographic material annually while keeping
  the same alias — encrypted files keep working without re-encryption.
- **Plaintext secrets are gitignored.** `.gitignore` covers `.env`,
  `.env.*` (with an exception only for `.env.example` and `.env.sops`),
  and `*.tfvars` (except `.tfvars.example` and `.tfvars.sops`). A stray
  `git add infra/terraform.tfvars` is blocked before it can stage.
- **`bin/setup.sh` decrypts to a scratch file and deletes it on exit.**
  The plaintext `terraform.tfvars` exists only for the duration of a
  Terraform apply; a bash `trap` on EXIT removes it via `rm -f` even if
  the script errors out.
- **Production secrets are injected into the Lambda as env vars** at
  `terraform apply` time. They do not appear in the Lambda's source
  package, any git artifact, or CI logs.
- **CI/CD uses GitHub OIDC** federation to assume an AWS role — there are
  no long-lived AWS access keys in GitHub secrets. The only GitHub
  Actions secret is `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` (studio deploy), which is a
  scope-limited "Deploy Studio" token, not an admin token.
- `.claude/settings.json` is committed (the rest of `.claude/` is
  gitignored — see `.gitignore`) and ships a project-wide deny-list of
  commands that write to external or destructive state: AWS resource
  deletion (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, IAM, KMS, Route 53, ACM, DynamoDB,
  CloudWatch Logs, Budgets), all `git push` operations, `git reset
  --hard`, `git clean -f`, `git branch -d/-D`, `rm -rf/-fr`,
  `terraform apply/destroy`, `gh secret set/delete`, `gh release
  create/delete`, `gh repo delete`, `gh workflow run`, and the studio
  deploy variants. Note: `git commit` is **not** blocked — Claude can
  create commits when a session explicitly permits it. Operators using
  Claude Code in the project inherit the deny-list automatically.

**Residual risk:**
- **An AWS credential with `kms:Decrypt` on the project key is a
  plaintext secret equivalent.** If an IAM access key with those
  permissions leaks, the attacker can decrypt everything in the repo.
  Mitigation: MFA on the AWS console account, short-lived credentials
  where possible, scoped IAM policies that only grant decrypt to
  identities that genuinely need it, CloudTrail alerting on unusual
  decrypt patterns.
- **Loss of AWS account access is catastrophic to this project** — both
  the secrets AND the Terraform state bucket AND the running
  infrastructure are gone. Mitigation is AWS account recovery hygiene:
  MFA with backup codes stored physically, a verified recovery email, a
  second admin user or role configured. This is outside the repo.
- Resend and Sanity dashboard credentials are outside AWS's blast radius
  and need their own MFA.
- **Encrypted files in git history survive rotation.** If a secret leaks
  and you rotate it, the old value is still readable by anyone with
  `kms:Decrypt` on the project key — but the new value in the current
  commit is different. Git history of rotated secrets is therefore only
  useful to an attacker who also has KMS access, which is the same
  trust boundary as the latest commit. Not a separate risk.

---

### 9. Dependency vulnerabilities

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | medium |
| **Impact** | low–medium |

**What could happen:** A transitive dependency (Hono, Sveltekit, Sanity
client, Resend SDK, esbuild, vitest, etc.) ships a CVE. We pick it up via
`pnpm install` on the next deploy.

**Current mitigations:**
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed — builds are reproducible.
- Direct deps are pinned or narrow-ranged. No `^0.x.*`-style wildcards on
  critical packages.
- No runtime code fetches from external sources.
- **Scheduled `pnpm audit`** (`.github/workflows/audit.yml`) runs every
  Monday at 06:00 UTC and on manual dispatch, scanning all workspaces at
  `--audit-level=moderate`. Findings open a `dependency-audit`-labelled
  GitHub issue; the next clean run auto-closes it.
- Dependabot is configured (grouped weekly updates per workspace) — see
  the roadmap.

**Residual risk:**
- `pnpm audit`'s vulnerability database lags GHSA/NVD by hours-to-days for
  newly-disclosed CVEs. For zero-day-class issues, manual response from
  GitHub Security alerts is the faster signal.
- Audit only catches *known* CVEs — supply-chain attacks via compromised
  packages with no published advisory pass through. Risk mitigated by
  `pnpm-lock.yaml` and only running `--frozen-lockfile` in CI/deploy
  workflows.

---

### 10. Stripe payment integrity

| | |
|---|---|
| **Likelihood** | low |
| **Impact** | medium |

**What could happen:** An attacker submits a tampered order with a lower
amount, or forges a Stripe webhook event to mark an unpaid order as paid.

**Current mitigations:**
- **Server-side amount computation**: the backend looks up product prices
  in Sanity and computes the total — the client never submits the amount.
  Prevents price-tampering attacks.
- **Webhook signature verification**: every request to `/webhooks/stripe`
  is validated by recomputing the HMAC-SHA256 of
  `timestamp + '.' + rawBody` against `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and
  comparing with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` against the `v1=…` value in
  the `stripe-signature` header. Forged events fail validation.
- **Amount cross-check**: the webhook handler compares
  `amount_total` on the Checkout Session against the `amountZar` stored
  on the Sanity order document. Mismatches are rejected.
- **Idempotency guard**: the webhook handler checks the order's current
  status. If it's already past `pending_payment`, the event is silently
  ignored — preventing double-processing on Stripe's automatic retries.
- **No card data on our server**: the Stripe Checkout model means card
  numbers never touch our infrastructure. PCI compliance scope is SAQ A
  (the lowest tier).

**Residual risk:**
- **If `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` leaks, an attacker can forge events.** A
  leaked webhook secret lets an attacker craft a valid signature over an
  arbitrary body, which would let them mark orders as paid without
  payment. Rotate by creating a new webhook endpoint (or rotating the
  existing one) in the Stripe dashboard, updating
  `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops`, then `terraform apply`.
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` leaking is also severe — it allows an attacker to
  create charges or refunds on the account. Rotate at Stripe → Developers
  → API keys, then re-apply Terraform.

---

## What this site explicitly does not protect against

Documenting the non-goals so they're not mistaken for gaps:

- **Nation-state or targeted attacks.** The threat model is
  "opportunistic bots + small-scale fraud." A determined adversary with
  meaningful resources will get through.
- **Account takeover of customer accounts.** There are no customer
  accounts.
- **Card fraud beyond Stripe's protections.** Stripe handles fraud
  detection and chargebacks for card payments. We rely on their PCI DSS
  Level 1 certified infrastructure.
- **DDoS.** Lambda + CloudFront absorb a surprising amount, but we haven't
  sized for an actual attack. WAF is out of scope.
- **Insider threat from the operator.** The operator has full Sanity
  access and can unilaterally edit every order. That's the cost of
  being the sole operator; the alternative is a much more complex
  admin split.

---

## Incident playbook (short version)

If something goes wrong:

1. **Suspected banking-detail impersonation.** Contact the bank immediately,
   notify Resend of phishing abuse, post a notice on the website. Rotation
   is not needed (the account isn't compromised, just being impersonated).
2. **Suspected `SANITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` leak.**
   - Generate a new secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
   - Update `infra/terraform.tfvars` → `terraform apply`.
   - Update the secret in the Sanity webhook configuration to match.
3. **Suspected `SANITY_API_TOKEN` leak.**
   - Revoke the token in Sanity dashboard → API → Tokens.
   - Create a new one, update `infra/terraform.tfvars` → `terraform apply`.
4. **Suspected `RESEND_API_KEY` leak.**
   - Revoke in the Resend dashboard.
   - Create a new key, update tfvars → apply.
4a. **Suspected `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` or `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` leak.**
   - Stripe dashboard → Developers → API keys → roll the secret key.
     For the webhook secret, open the relevant endpoint and click
     "Roll endpoint secret" (or create a new endpoint and migrate).
   - Update `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops` with the new values.
   - `terraform apply` to push the new values to the Lambda.
5. **Sanity database compromised or accidentally made public.**
   - In the Sanity dashboard, set the `production` dataset to **private**
     (it should already be).
   - Revoke and rotate `SANITY_API_TOKEN` regardless, since it was the only
     thing standing between anonymous clients and the order documents.
6. **IAM credential with `kms:Decrypt` leaked.** (e.g. an AWS access key
   pair for your operator user showed up in a public place, or a role's
   temporary credentials were exfiltrated.)
   - Revoke the credential immediately — deactivate the access key in the
     IAM console, or `aws iam update-access-key --status Inactive`.
   - Pull CloudTrail to see what the credential actually did: every
     `Decrypt` call against the project KMS key is logged.
     ```bash
     aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
       --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=Decrypt \
       --region af-south-1 --max-results 50
     ```
     Filter for events whose `resources` includes the project key ARN and
     whose source IP / user agent looks suspicious.
   - If the attacker could have decrypted the SOPS files during the
     exposure window, treat every secret in `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops`
     and `backend/.env.sops` as leaked. Rotate all of them in their source
     dashboards (Resend, Sanity API token, Sanity webhook secret).
   - Update the values via `sops infra/terraform.tfvars.sops` and `sops
     backend/.env.sops`, then `terraform apply`.
   - Optionally also rotate the KMS key itself by creating a new key and
     updating the alias (see `docs/deployment.md § Rotating the KMS key`).
     Not strictly required — the leaked credential can't grant itself new
     permissions — but a defence-in-depth move.
7. **AWS account compromised.** (Not just one credential — the whole
   account.) This is a major incident; treat the project's KMS key as
   owned by the attacker.
   - Regain control of the AWS account via AWS account recovery (phone
     verification, support ticket if needed).
   - Once back in, rotate every IAM credential in the account, enable
     MFA on the root user if not already, audit CloudTrail for the full
     exposure window.
   - Rotate every secret in the repo at its source dashboard.
   - Create a new KMS key (or rotate the existing one as in deployment.md),
     re-encrypt the SOPS files, commit.
   - Run `terraform apply` to push the new values.
   - Consider whether the infrastructure itself was tampered with
     (Lambda code, S3 bucket contents, IAM policies) and reprovision as
     needed.
8. **Lost AWS account access entirely** (account closed, recovery failed).
   - The encrypted files in git are no longer recoverable by you — they
     were encrypted under a KMS key you no longer control. This is a
     recovery incident, not a security incident (the secrets are not
     leaked, they're just no longer readable by you).
   - Regenerate every secret from its source dashboard (Resend, Sanity).
   - Create a new AWS account, run `bin/sops-init.sh` to provision a
     fresh KMS key, fill in the encrypted files with the new values.
   - Commit. Run the full `bin/setup.sh` to re-provision infrastructure
     under the new account.
   - Total downtime depends on how long AWS account creation takes and
     DNS propagation — typically 1–2 hours.

## PII retention (POPIA Section 14)

The site stores customer PII on Sanity order documents: `customerName`,
`customerEmail`, `customerPhone`, `shippingAddress`, `customerNotes`, and
the operator-only `internalNotes`. POPIA requires retention to be tied to
a documented purpose, so the longer this PII sits in Sanity past
fulfilment, the weaker the legal posture.

### The policy

- **Retention window**: 12 months after `_updatedAt`, for orders in a
  terminal state (`delivered` or `cancelled`).
- **What gets cleared**: `customerName`, `customerEmail`,
  `customerPhone`, `shippingAddress`, `customerNotes`, `internalNotes`
  → all set to `null`.
- **What's preserved**: `orderRef`, `status`, `amountZar`,
  `paymentMethod`, `paymentId`, `_createdAt`, and `items` (the line-item
  product summary, no PII). Sufficient for SARS audit, dispute resolution,
  and revenue accounting; insufficient for re-identifying the customer.
- **Declared in the public privacy policy** at
  `frontend/src/routes/privacy/+page.svelte` § "How long we keep it".
  Required by POPIA — the retention period must be visible to the data
  subject, not only documented internally.

### Automated enforcement

`backend/src/pii-cleanup.ts` runs the sweep. The same Lambda function
that serves the API is invoked once a month by an EventBridge schedule
rule (`infra/pii_cleanup.tf`, `cron(0 4 1 * ? *)` — 04:00 UTC on the 1st).
The dispatcher in `backend/src/lambda.ts` detects
`event.source === 'aws.events'` and routes to `runPiiCleanup()` instead of
the Hono HTTP handler.

The cleanup is idempotent — clearing PII updates `_updatedAt`, so
already-cleaned orders self-exclude from the next month's query. Per-order
failures are logged and the run continues; the summary line in CloudWatch
Logs shows `cutoff=`, `scanned=`, `cleared=`, `failed=`.

Override the retention period via the `RETENTION_DAYS` env var on the
Lambda if the legal posture changes. Default is 365 days.

### Manual fallback

If the automated sweep is disabled (EventBridge rule paused, Lambda
broken, retention policy under review), the same outcome can be achieved
by hand from the Sanity Studio. Quarterly is a reasonable cadence;
monthly matches the automated schedule.

1. Open Sanity Studio → **Orders**.
2. Filter by `status` = `delivered` OR `cancelled`.
3. Sort by `_updatedAt` ascending.
4. For every order whose `_updatedAt` is more than 12 months ago:
   - Open the document.
   - Clear (delete the value of) every field in this list:
     `customerName`, `customerEmail`, `customerPhone`, `shippingAddress`,
     `customerNotes`, `internalNotes`.
   - Click **Publish**.
5. Note the date of the manual sweep in the operator runbook.

The fields to keep, even during the manual sweep, are the same as the
automated job: `orderRef`, `status`, `amountZar`, `paymentMethod`,
`paymentId`, `items`. **Do not delete the order document itself** — that
removes the audit trail for tax purposes.

### Verifying it ran

CloudWatch Logs for the Lambda will show a line like:

```
[pii-cleanup] cutoff=2026-04-16T04:00:00.000Z scanned=12 cleared=12 failed=0
```

once a month. If it doesn't appear for two consecutive months, something
broke — either the EventBridge rule is disabled, the Lambda permission is
missing, or the function itself is failing silently. Fall back to the
manual procedure above and investigate.

## Known hardening gaps (roadmap items)

Captured here so they don't get lost:

- **Dedicated sender domain with DMARC/SPF/DKIM** for the outbound Resend
  email identity, to make impersonation harder outside the repo.
- **Signed tokens on tracking URLs** instead of email-in-querystring. Low
  priority.
- **AWS WAF in front of CloudFront** for distributed-attacker
  rate limiting (the in-memory limiter only caps per-instance). Out of
  scope at current volume; revisit if real attack traffic appears.
