# Roadmap

This document tracks what's built, what's left before launch, and what's
planned for later. Items move between sections as they're shipped.

## Status at a glance

**The app is code-complete for v1.** Every feature in the original brief
(home with hero + story, shop with Stripe Checkout, customer order
tracking, CMS) is built. All three workspace packages typecheck clean and
build clean. Deployment is a single command (`bin/setup.sh`).

What's actually pending is divided into two buckets:

1. **One-time external setup** — accounts, DNS, running the setup script,
   the team adding content. All documented in [`deployment.md`](./deployment.md).
2. **Nice-to-haves** — performance polish, editorial improvements, optional
   features the team may or may not want.

Nothing structural is missing and no work is blocked.

## What's been built (the whole "done" list)

This is here so the rest of the roadmap has context and so you can see how
much of the brief is already shipped.

### Core site
- [x] Home page with hero photograph and story
- [x] Shop page with Sanity-backed product catalogue
- [x] Contact page
- [x] Order form → Sanity order document → owner + customer emails
- [x] Customer order tracking page at `/track`
- [x] Automated customer status emails on order status changes
- [x] Under-construction banner removed

### Content management
- [x] Sanity Studio with three schemas: `product`, `testimonial`, `order`
- [x] Product reads routed through the backend (so the dataset can stay private)
- [x] Order creation writes to Sanity with full PII protection

### Polish
- [x] Favicon (brand-colored SVG)
- [x] `robots.txt` with `/track` disallowed
- [x] Per-route `<title>`, meta description, Open Graph, Twitter Card tags
- [x] Hero image compressed (3.6 MB → 643 KB via `sips`)
- [x] Client-side loading with skeleton states on shop (page shell
      appears instantly; data loads and images lazy-load progressively)
- [x] `loading="lazy"` on all shop images
- [x] Product cards aligned so buttons stay on the same baseline regardless
      of blurb/description length
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` guard on the skeleton shimmer animation
- [x] Hero `rel="preload"` hint
- [x] `theme-color` meta for mobile address-bar tinting

### Infrastructure
- [x] Monorepo restructured into `frontend/`, `backend/`, `studio/`, `infra/`
- [x] Terraform module for S3, CloudFront, OAC, ACM cert, Route 53,
      Lambda, IAM, GitHub OIDC
- [x] Three GitHub Actions deploy workflows (frontend, backend, studio)
      with OIDC federation — no long-lived AWS keys in secrets
- [x] Release-gated deploys: each deploy workflow fires only when a
      GitHub release is published (not on every push to `main`), with a
      skip-if-unchanged check job that compares the current release tag
      against the previous one and skips deploys for workspaces whose
      files didn't change. `workflow_dispatch` is retained as an escape
      hatch for manual re-runs, and the frontend also listens for
      `repository_dispatch: sanity-publish` so content edits rebuild
      without a code release.
- [x] Secrets management via SOPS + AWS KMS. `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops`
      and `backend/.env.sops` are committed encrypted, decryptable by
      anyone with `kms:Decrypt` on the project's dedicated KMS key
      (`alias/thong-biltong-sops` in `af-south-1`). `bin/sops-init.sh`
      bootstraps the KMS key idempotently; `bin/setup.sh` decrypts tfvars
      into a scratch file at start and shreds it on exit. See
      `docs/deployment.md § Secrets management`.
- [x] `bin/setup.sh` one-command bootstrap (state bucket, `terraform apply`,
      GitHub Actions variables, Sanity dataset privacy, backend webhook)
- [x] `bin/sops-init.sh` one-command SOPS bootstrap (KMS key creation,
      `.sops.yaml` placeholder substitution, encrypted-file seeding)
- [x] Dependabot configured with grouped weekly updates for all three
      workspace packages + GitHub Actions
- [x] Backend Lambda bundling via esbuild
- [x] Backend env loading via `dotenv` for local dev (stripped from the
      Lambda bundle via entry-point isolation — `lambda.ts` deliberately
      does not import `server.ts`)

### Testing
- [x] Vitest test suite across backend and frontend. Backend covers email
      templates + HTML escaping, `sendEmail` with mocked Resend fetch,
      Sanity webhook HMAC verification, Stripe webhook signature
      verification, `POST /orders` + `GET /orders/:ref`, `/products`,
      CORS (including `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` fallback behaviour), `/health`,
      404 handling, and a regression guard that fails if banking details
      ever reappear in the automated pending-payment email. Frontend
      covers `formatPrice` (null, zero, positive, large numbers) and
      `imageUrl` (width omitted/included, null project-id branch). All
      tests mock Sanity, Resend, and Stripe so they run offline. Root
      `pnpm test` runs both workspaces.
- [x] CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm check` + `pnpm
      test` on every PR and every push to `main`/`dev`, with
      cancel-in-progress concurrency so rapid pushes don't stack up.

### Developer experience
- [x] All dependencies upgraded to latest major versions (Svelte 5.55,
      SvelteKit 2.57, Vite 8, TypeScript 6, Sanity 5, React 19, Hono 4.12,
      @sanity/client 7, etc.)
- [x] Dead boilerplate dependencies removed (Storybook, `unplugin-icons`,
      `mdsvex`, `normalize.css`, `isomorphic-dompurify`)
- [x] `$app/stores` → `$app/state` migration so the layout compiles cleanly
      under Svelte 5's strict rune rules
- [x] `pnpm dev` runs frontend + backend in parallel with HMR
- [x] Clean typecheck + build across all three packages

### Documentation
- [x] `docs/architecture.md` — full system overview with flow diagrams
- [x] `docs/features.md` — per-page feature list
- [x] `docs/run-locally.md` — local dev setup walkthrough
- [x] `docs/deployment.md` — deployment guide with release-gated workflow,
      SOPS + KMS secrets management, env var reference, rollback,
      troubleshooting, and "adding a new content type" playbook
- [x] `docs/orders-and-tracking.md` — detailed order flow
- [x] `docs/security.md` — cross-cutting risk register, mitigations,
      incident playbook, hardening gaps (rate limiting, `pnpm audit`,
      order-ref entropy, DMARC/SPF)
- [x] `infra/README.md` — Terraform module reference
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` — repo guidance loaded into every Claude Code session
- [x] Root `README.md`

## Remaining before launch

These are the things that actually block flipping the switch to live
traffic. Most are external, and each is documented with exact steps in
[`deployment.md`](./deployment.md).

### Content (needs the owner)
- [ ] Reusable banking-details email reply block. The automated
      pending-payment confirmation no longer contains banking details at
      all; they're sent manually in reply to each order (intentional —
      see `docs/security.md § Risk 1` for the impersonation threat
      model). The team needs a saved email snippet with the real values
      so the reply takes 30 seconds per order, not 3 minutes.
- [ ] Real contact details on `frontend/src/routes/contact/+page.svelte`:
      - [x] real email — `hello@thongbiltong.co.za` (confirmed 2026-04-16)
      - [ ] phone number (or remove the row — `TODO` in markup; current
            placeholder reads "By email first, please.")
      - [ ] curing room location/town (`TODO` in markup; current placeholder
            reads "Based in Cape Town. Shipped nationwide.")
- [ ] Populate the shop with real products via Sanity Studio

### External accounts
- [ ] Resend account with verified sending domain (DNS propagation wait
      is typically 5–30 min)
- [ ] Stripe account with live keys (`sk_live_…` / `pk_live_…`) and a
      live-mode webhook endpoint pointed at `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- [ ] Sanity: set `production` dataset visibility to **Private** in the
      dashboard, or let `bin/setup.sh` do it by providing `SANITY_ADMIN_TOKEN`
- [ ] AWS account with `af-south-1` region enabled (opt-in regions need a
      manual click)
- [ ] Domain registered + Route 53 hosted zone existing

### Deployment
- [ ] Run `./bin/sops-init.sh` to provision the project's KMS key and seed
      encrypted `infra/terraform.tfvars.sops` + `backend/.env.sops` from
      the examples
- [ ] Fill in real values: `sops infra/terraform.tfvars.sops` and `sops
      backend/.env.sops`
- [ ] Run `./bin/setup.sh` (one command, ~15 min of which is CloudFront
      propagation)
- [ ] Cut the first GitHub release to trigger the release-gated deploy
      workflows:
      ```bash
      gh release create v0.1.0 --generate-notes --target main
      ```
      This fires `deploy-frontend`, `deploy-backend`, and `deploy-studio`
      in parallel. The first release has no previous tag so all three
      workspaces deploy regardless of the skip-if-unchanged check.
- [ ] Run `pnpm studio deploy` once locally (interactive first-time only)
- [ ] Add `SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret for CI studio deploys
- [ ] Create the content-rebuild Sanity webhook via the dashboard (needs
      a GitHub fine-grained PAT that can't be automated from `gh`)

### Pre-launch verification
- [ ] End-to-end order flow test with a real Resend account (see
      `deployment.md` § End-to-end verification)
- [ ] Run Lighthouse on the live site and address any critical findings
- [ ] Test on a real phone (touch targets, form keyboards, scroll behavior)

## Near-term post-launch

Nice-to-haves worth doing once the site is live and there's real feedback.
None are blocking; pick the ones that match observed pain.

- [ ] Compress the hero further with a dedicated tool (mozjpeg / squoosh)
      — currently 643 KB, could realistically hit ~200 KB
- [ ] Responsive `srcset` on shop images for better mobile performance
- [ ] Low-quality image placeholder (LQIP) blur-up loading for smoother
      image appearance
- [ ] Extend the CMS to cover home page story and hero photo so non-devs
      can edit those
- [x] Rate limiting on `POST /orders`, `GET /orders/:ref`, and the two
      webhook endpoints — per-IP fixed-window in-memory limiter
      (`backend/src/rate-limit.ts`)
- [ ] Structured product picker on the order form (checkboxes + quantities
      per product) — only worth it once there are enough products that
      the free-text field feels clumsy
- [ ] "About the brand" page
- [ ] Archive of past / sold-out products
- [ ] Newsletter signup (only if the team wants it)
- [ ] Lambda alias for cleaner one-command rollback (right now rollback is
      via "re-run the previous workflow"; works but an alias is tidier)
- [ ] Sitemap.xml generator
- [ ] Second-photo upload workflow for biltong product shots (pack shot
      + sliced detail crop), so the hover-reveal pattern on the shop tile
      always has a second image to reveal

## Longer-term / speculative

Only build these if there's a concrete reason. Each represents a meaningful
step up in complexity and shouldn't be taken lightly.

- [x] Card payments via Stripe Checkout — hosted session integration
      supporting Card, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. No PCI scope for us
      (redirect model). Stripe webhook auto-confirms payments in Sanity.
- [ ] Inventory tracking with real stock counts — requires a database. The
      current `available` boolean works for made-to-order and one-offs.
- [ ] Multi-language (English + Afrikaans) — adds routing, content
      translations, and duplicated CMS fields.
- [ ] Integration with a shipping provider for live tracking (Courier Guy,
      Aramex, etc.) — right now the team pastes the tracking number into
      the order document by hand.
- [ ] Order admin dashboard — marked promoted earlier but in practice the
      Sanity Studio IS this dashboard, so the item is moot unless the
      team outgrows Studio's list view.

## Explicit non-goals

Things we deliberately will not build unless the business case changes
materially.

- **Customer accounts / login.** The site is small and order tracking is
  key-based (ref + email). Accounts would be friction for no gain.
- **Real-time chat / live support.**
- **A mobile app.** Everything important works in a mobile browser.
- **Marketplace features.** Only one seller, not a platform.
- **Bank API integration for direct payouts / reconciliation.** Stripe
  already auto-confirms payments via its webhook and handles payouts, so
  there's no manual confirmation step that bank-API access would shorten.
